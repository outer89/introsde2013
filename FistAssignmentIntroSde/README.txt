Hi.

To run just type in the terminal "ant execute".

It will at first execute part 2, which creates a xml file in the directory, after it the xml schema is red and validated using the xsd schema (so i marshal some data and then unmarhsall it).

After it the part 1 is executed: getHeight, getWeight, getHealthprofile and the function that prints people (with theirs health profile) with parameters.
The method of printAll is temporarly disabled becasue the file contains more than 1000 people and is a bit long to scroll it in the terminal. 

In order to see such method working just un-comment line 37 in Main.java and run again "ant execute".

Use "ant clean" to clean directories generated by compilation and execution.
